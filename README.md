Instructions on how to create a test:

1. create a generator file in /generators, with a name of type generate_*_tests.py.
This should create multiple tests files in /tests with the name of type *_test.py.

2. Any neccesary resources/templates should be places in /templates.

For an example, check generators/generate_login_tests.py and templates/logintemplate.py. 


Instructions on how to run tests:
run ./testrunner to git pull new tests, run all the generator files, run the tests, and then delete all test files.
